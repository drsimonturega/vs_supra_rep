## Introduction

This is a reanalysis of the predictive model from the "Virtual screening for high affinity guests for synthetic supramolecular receptors", https://doi.org/10.1039/C5SC00534E. The original model was a multivariate linear regression run in microsoft excel. I am going to move this to python for use in teaching. Initialy I will keep the experiemnt as close to the original literature as possible for use in my teaching on a university teaching module "Introduction to data science" at Hallam university.

## Code development
This repoduces the analysis in the manuscript and then reanalysis the data using a current data science approach. It uses my data science library[simons_data_science_library](https://github.com/drsimonturega/simons_data_science_library) to facilitate the complettion of the task in a one hour session.

## Usage instructions
Currently we make run the our notebook [vs_supra_rep_002.ipynb](https://github.com/drsimonturega/vs_supra_rep/blob/main/vs_supra_rep_002.ipynb)

## File structure of the project
There are **.txt* files copied from the suplimentory information in the manscript. There are also two **.ipynb* one of which we will run in google colab in our session.
